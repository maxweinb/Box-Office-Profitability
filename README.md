As I have explained in the description, this is an exploration to discover what factors contribute to box office success of some of the highest rated 
films listed on Rotten Tomatoes prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, when all cinemas were shut down.
In this project, I used R to find these contributors by creating Multiple Linear Regression model, using tactics such as Stepwise and Best Subsets Models.
I then created visualizations of the data in Tableau, culminating in a Tableau Story to display my findings recommendations for further exploration.
